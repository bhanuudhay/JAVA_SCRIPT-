## üìÅ What‚Äôs Inside

### 1. JavaScript Basics
- **01_var.js**: A deep dive into variable declaration using `var`.
- **02_dataTypes.js**: Understanding the different data types JavaScript offers.
- **03_conversionOperation.js**: Exploring various operations for data conversion.
- **04_comparisons.js**: Summarizing comparison operators and their uses.
- **05_Strings.js**: Getting to grips with string manipulation techniques.
- **06_nums-ans-math.js**: More on math operations and number handling.
- **07_dateandtime.js**: Revision of date and time functions in JS.
- **dataTypes-summary.js**: A quick summary of heap vs. stack memory.

### 2. Arrays and Objects
- **01_Arrays.js**: An introduction to arrays and how to work with them.
- **02_Arrays.js**: A continuation of array methods and functionalities.
- **03_Objects.js**: Exploring objects and their properties.
- **04_Objects.js**: More on object methods and how to manipulate them.

### 3. Functions and Scopes
- **01_functions.js**: Everything about defining and using functions.
- **02_Scopes.js**: Learning about scope, arrow functions, and IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).
- **03_Arrows.js**: Delving deeper into arrow functions and scope.
- **04_iife.js**: Understanding IIFEs and their benefits.

### 4. Control Flow
- **01_if_else.js**: An overview of `if-else` statements and `switch` cases.
- **02_switch.js**: More on `switch` statements and when to use them.
- **03_truthy.js**: Exploring truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.

### 5. Loops
- **01_forloop.js**: Getting started with the classic `for` loop.
- **02_whileloops.js**: Understanding `while` and `do-while` loops.
- **03_highOrderLoop.js**: Introduction to the `for...of` loop for easier iteration.
- **04_highOrderLoop2.js**: Exploring the `for...in` loop for object properties.
- **05_foreachloop.js**: In-depth look at the `forEach` method for arrays.
- **06_mapfilter.js**: Understanding how to use `map` and `filter` for array manipulation.

### 6. HTML Practice
- **four.html**: Practice adding, replacing, and removing elements in the DOM.
- **one.html**: Just some notes and thoughts on HTML and JavaScript.
- **three.html**: Learning to create new elements in the DOM.
- **two.html**: Additional practice and notes on various concepts.

### 7. Projects
- **Color Change Background**: Changes the background color when clicking on an image.
- **Time Watch**: A simple watch that displays the current time.
- **BMI Calculator**: A tool to calculate Body Mass Index.
- **Calculate Age**: Computes age based on the birthdate provided.
- **Random Background**: Uses a random library to change the background every second. Clicking "Stop" halts the color change, while "Start" resumes it using `setInterval`.

### 8. Events
- **Event Listener Study**: Explores how to use `addEventListener` to manage events.
- **Async Operators**: Delve into asynchronous programming and the use of async/await for handling promises.

## üîç What I've Learned

Throughout this journey, I've tackled a range of topics, including:
- **Variables & Data Types**: Getting comfortable with different data types and how to declare variables.
- **Arrays & Objects**: Learning the ins and outs of data structures and how to manipulate them effectively.
- **Functions**: Understanding function declarations, expressions, and the magic of IIFEs and arrow functions.
- **Control Flow**: Mastering conditional statements and loops to control the flow of my programs.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Gaining hands-on experience with basic DOM manipulation to create dynamic web pages.

### 9. Advanced Concepts
- **Promises**: Understanding promises, how to handle asynchronous operations, and working with `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `async/await`.
- **API Requests**: Making HTTP requests using `fetch`, handling JSON responses, and working with RESTful APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Using `try/catch` blocks, understanding errors in asynchronous code, and dealing with exceptions.

### 10. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes & Inheritance**: Learning about classes, inheritance, constructors, and how to create objects with classes.
- **Getter & Setter Methods**: Defining and using getter and setter methods to control property access and modification.
- **Static Properties & Methods**: Working with static properties and methods to define functionality that doesn't rely on instance properties.
- **Prototype & Prototype Chain**: Understanding the prototype chain, adding methods to the prototype, and inheritance in JavaScript.
- **Object Descriptors**: Using `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` to inspect and define object property attributes like `writable`, `configurable`, and `enumerable`.

### 11. Miscellaneous Topics
- **Bind, Call, and Apply**: Understanding how to use `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` to control the `this` context in functions.
- **Event Delegation**: Implementing event delegation to optimize event handling and manage dynamic content.
- **Modules**: Learning how to use JavaScript ES6 modules (`import/export`) to organize and separate code.
- **Memory Management**: Understanding how JavaScript handles memory, including garbage collection and heap vs. stack memory.
