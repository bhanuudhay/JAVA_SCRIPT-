<!--
java script is synchronos  // step by  step code execution
single thread // ek thread pe sab execute hoga

this two is default execution behavviour

Execution context
line execute one by one 

blocking code vs non blocking code

blocking code : block the flow of code eg i'm going to drink water and meantime you can't able to do anything

non- block code: doesnot block the flow of code 
eg read file async

both are best at their own place
